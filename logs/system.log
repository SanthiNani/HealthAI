Exercise 3: Identifying Biases

Identify any potential biases in the following statement: "Elderly people are more likely to contract covid-19."

Answer: The statement assumes a correlation between age and the likelihood of contracting covid-19, which is not supported by evidence. It may also be influenced by stereotypes or prejudices related to age.




Welcome to the world of economics! In this section, we will be exploring the concepts and principles of economics.

To begin, let's talk about the concept of supply and demand. Supply and demand is the idea that the price of a good or service is determined by the relationship between how much of it exists and how much people want it. If there is a lot of demand for a good or service, the price will go up. If there is less demand, the price will go down. This is all based on the concept of law of supply and demand.

Another important concept in economics is opportunity cost. Opportunity cost is the idea that there is always a cost to every decision. For example, if you decide to buy a new video game, the opportunity cost is that you cannot buy a new toy or a book. This is because you have to give up something else in order to get the new video game.

Question 5: Alex spends 40 minutes getting ready in the morning, 2 hours on his commute, and 45 minutes at work. How many minutes does he spend on his activities in a day?

Solution 5:
To find the total time Alex spends on his activities in a day, we need to add up the time he spends getting ready, his commute, and his time at work.

Time spent getting ready = 40 minutes
Time spent on his commute = 2 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
Time spent at work = 45 minutes

Total time spent on activities in a day = 40 minutes + 120 minutes + 45 minutes = 205 minutes

Therefore, Alex spends 205 minutes on his activities in a day.

Exercise 3: Research and write a short paragraph about a fundamental health issue that was prevalent in the years 1975-1990.

Answer: During the years 1975-1990, one of the fundamental health issues that was prevalent was the increasing cases of HIV/AIDS. HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus, and it attacks the immune system, making it difficult for the body to fight off infections and diseases. This disease was particularly devastating as it had a high mortality rate, with many people dying from it within a few years of diagnosis. The lack of knowledge and understanding about HIV/AIDS led to stigma and discrimination, making it harder for affected individuals to seek proper medical care and support. Thankfully, advancements in medical research and treatment have since improved the quality of life for those living with HIV/AIDS.

Question 3: A store sells T-shirts for $15 each. Jane bought 5 T-shirts and paid a total of $75. How much change did Jane receive?

Solution:

To find the change Jane received, we need to subtract the total cost of the T-shirts from the amount she paid.

Given that each T-shirt costs $15, and Jane bought 5 T-shirts, we can calculate the total cost of the T-shirts:

Total cost of T-shirts = $15/T-shirt * 5 T-shirts = $75

To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the T-shirts from the amount Jane paid:

Change = Amount paid - Total cost of T-shirts = $75 - $75 = $0

Therefore, Jane received $0 as change.
